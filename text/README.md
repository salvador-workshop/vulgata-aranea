# VULGATA ARANEA - Text

The text of this digital bible comes from _"The Clementine Vulgate Project (VulSearch)"_. The `original` text was scraped from the _"VulSearch 4"_ UI, and represents what a user would see if they selected the _"Vulgata Clementina"_ bible.

I was drawn to this version because it's free software and the desktop version of _VulSearch_ features Ecclesial Latin accents. It took just a small amount of extra code to export the accented text to simple Unicode files. Shout-out to the authors of their accentuation algorithm.
