# VULGATA ARANEA

> Vulgate of the Web

## Purpose and Goals

This project aims to produce a version of the latin Vulgate Bible which:

1. is native to the web
1. is presented beautifully, both in typography and visuals
1. is a useful study aid for Catholic dorks like myself, or anyone else

### Dedication

> _"Verbum autem Dómini manet in ætérnum..."_ (Petri I, 1:25)  
_"But the Word of the Lord endureth forever"_ (1 Peter, 1:25)

Those words became a motto of the Protestant Reformation, but this Catholic boy fully agrees. The Lord's Word endures forever, and I endure with that Word. May this project serve as a reminder and reinforcement of the Word in the digital realm.

— R. J. Salvador

## The Clementine Vulgate Project (VulSearch)

I owe much to Michael Tweedale et al. for their work on The Clementine Vulgate Project. In many ways, I've just dressed up the texts they've produced.
